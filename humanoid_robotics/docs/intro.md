# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This book serves as a capstone guide to the future of AI, where intelligence extends beyond digital spaces and into the physical world. We will explore **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality, comprehend physical laws, and interact with their environment.

**Our Goal:** To bridge the gap between the digital brain and the physical body, empowering you to apply your AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in both simulated and real-world environments.

Throughout this course, you will learn to:
- Design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions.
- Master key robotics platforms like **ROS 2**, **Gazebo**, and the **NVIDIA Isaac™** ecosystem.
- Integrate advanced AI models for vision, language, and action, enabling robots to understand and execute complex commands.

Let's begin the journey of bringing AI to life.
